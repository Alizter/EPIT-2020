## Contents

### Part 1: Dependent type theory

* Dependent type theory (judgements, rules, universes)
* Exercises: basic types (`unit`, `empty`, `bool`, `N`)

### Part 2: Dependent sums and products

* `Σ` `Π`, `→`, `×`
* Exercises: `+`, dependent currying


### Part 3: Identity types


Exercises:
* (non-dependent) transport, `Σ (x : A) Id (x, y)`
* why we cannot prove UIP by path induction


### Part 4: Homotopy levels

* Part 4: contractibility, propositions, homotopy levels
* Exercises: logic via propositions-as-propositions

### Part 5: Equivalences & isomorphism

* Equivalences & isomorphism
* Exercise: universal property of set truncation

### Part 6: Univalence

* Univalence
* Exercise: equality of algebraic structures
