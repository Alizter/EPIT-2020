# EPIT-2020

[EPIT 2020 - Spring School on Homotopy Type Theory](https://epit2020cnrs.inria.fr) course materials and planning.

Course units are organized into folders:

* [Introduction to homotopy type theory](./01-introduction-to-hott)
* [The CoQ-HoTT library](./02-Coq-HoTT)
* Models of Homotopy Type Theory
* [Cubical Type Theory and Cubical Agda](./04-cubical-type-theory)
* [Synthetic Homotopy Theory](./05-synthetic-homotopy-theory)
* Arend Proof Assistant

**The program of the week will be lectures/exercise sessions from 2pm to 6.30pm (UTC+2). We will organize virtual social events in the evening.**
