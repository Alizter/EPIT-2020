We shall keep a strict schedule. Each block of two parts will consist of a lecture, followed by exercises and a discussion.

# Background reading
On the second day we shall dive deeper into HoTT and, in particular, its formalization in a proof assistant.
We will use the [Coq](coq.inria.fr/) implementation of type theory, and specifically the [HoTT](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT) library.
There is much [tutorial](https://coq.inria.fr/documentation) material available for Coq.
Andrej Bauers's [video tutorials](http://math.andrej.com/2011/02/22/video-tutorials-for-the-coq-proof-assistant/) 
are perhaps the most accessible. [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/) can also be useful.

Please make sure you have Coq with the HoTT library [installed](https://github.com/HoTT/EPIT-2020/blob/main/Coq-Playground/README.md).

## Contents

This second lecture series will partially follow the structure of the first lecture, 
but show how to formalize these aspects in HoTT.

### Part 1: Inroduction to Coq (for HoTT)
### Part 2: Intro to the HoTT library
### Part 3: Higher-inductive types in Coq
### Part 4: h-Levels, images, type classes
###	Part 5: Quotients and impredicativity
###	Part 6: Axioms

## Exercises
Formalize the Exercises of day 1 using the HoTT library.

If you are a beginner, you will learn a lot by finding and replaying the existing lemmas.
More experienced users are encouraged to write the statements and proofs from scratch.
