We shall keep a strict schedule. Each part will consist of a short lecture, followed by exercises and a discussion.

# Background reading
On the second day we shall dive deeper into HoTT and, in particular, its formalization in a proof assistant.
We will use the [Coq](coq.inria.fr/) implementation of type theory, and specifically the [HoTT](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT) library.
There is much [tutorial](https://coq.inria.fr/documentation) material available for Coq.
Andrej Bauers's [video tutorials](http://math.andrej.com/2011/02/22/video-tutorials-for-the-coq-proof-assistant/) 
are perhaps the most accessible.

Please make sure you have Coq with the HoTT library [installed](https://github.com/HoTT/EPIT-2020/blob/main/Coq-Playground/README.md).
